    <p style="color: black;">"I'm not going to run away, I never go back on my word! That is my nindo: My Ninja Way!" Naruto taught us a lot but the most important thing he taught us is to NEVER GIVE UP in life and what ever you want to achieve will not come to you , you have to work your way though.</p>
